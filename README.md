# Scaffold with TopAppBar, BottomBar, and FAB â€“ Jetpack Compose

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Scaffold** layout in Jetpack Compose with a **top bar**, **bottom navigation bar**, and **floating action button (FAB)** that displays a **Snackbar** when clicked.  
It also uses `innerPadding` to ensure the content area does not overlap with the top or bottom bars.

---

## Features
- **Top App Bar**  
  Displays the app title at the top of the screen.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**  
  Contains three navigation items: **Home**, **Settings**, and **Profile**.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB)**  
  Clicking the FAB shows a **Snackbar message**.
- **Proper innerPadding**  
  Content adjusts dynamically to avoid being hidden behind the top or bottom bars.
